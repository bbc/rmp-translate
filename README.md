RMP\Translate
=============
A small composer library to load .po (GetText) translation files and provide a simple API for translations in /programmes and Amen.

This is essentially a wrapper that simplifies the use of Symfony\Translation.

## Why?

/programmes is currently being translated into a wide variety of languages for BBC World Service. This requires a translation file format that non-technical users can safely handle. GetText is about the only widely supported format with fully featured editors (including a [web based one](https://localise.biz/free/poeditor/demo)).

GetText is based around feeding strings in a source language to a translation layer, and having those translated into a target language. BBC localisation generally uses placeholder strings which are replaced with a localised string at run time.

RMP\Translate simplifies the usage of this translation format with Symfony translate, provides a script to convert existing msgformat (BBC_Localisation) files to .po files, and works around some of the bugs that crop up using Symfony translate.


## Basic Usage

### Installation

First you'll need to include the library in your composer.json like so:


     "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "git@github.com:bbc/rmp-translate.git"
            }
        ],
        "require": {
            "bbc-rmp/translate": "dev-master"
        }


### Instantiation

You then need to set up the configuration and instantiate the translate class. A basic example follows. More details
on the configuration options and recommended usage are included below
```php
use RMP\Translate\TranslateFactory;
use RMP\Translate\Translate;
// Set to any supported language
$locale = 'en_GB';
$options = array();
$factory = new TranslateFactory();
$translate = $factory->create($locale, $options);
```
### Translation

Gettext input files and PHP code for some basic examples.

Simple translation:

```
msgid "all_episodes_iplayer"
msgstr "All episodes available on BBC iPlayer"
```
```php
$placeholder = 'all_episodes_iplayer';
$englishText = $translate->translate($placeholder);
// $englishText now contains  "All episodes available on BBC iPlayer"
```
With substition:
```
msgid "category_title"
msgstr "Programmes categorised as %1"
```
```php
$placeholder = 'category_title';
$englishText = $translate->translate($placeholder, array('%1' => 'Factual');
// $englishText now contains  "Programmes categorised as Factual"
```
With pluralisation:
```
msgid "available_count"
msgid_plural "available_count %count%"
msgstr[0] "There are currently no available episodes"
msgstr[1] "There is currently %count% available episode"
msgstr[2] "There are currently %count% available episodes"
```
```php
$placeholder = 'available_count';
$noItemsText = $translate->translate($placeholder, array('%count%' => 0), 0);
// $noItemsText = 'There are currently no available episodes'
$someItemsText = $translate->translate($placeholder, array('%count%' => 3), 3);
// $someItemsText = 'There are currently 3 available episodes'
```

### Updating translation files with new placeholders

This is a two step process. You need to update both the programmes.pot template and the English translation file.
Sorry, but that's the way GetText expects you to work.

#### To add an entry

Open `src/RMP/Translate/lang/programmes/programmes.pot` and add your new entry.

```
#.The English translation
msgid "my_shiny_new_entry"
msgstr ""
```

The comment should contain the full english translation and is needed as guidance for translators in other languages.

**msgid can only contain the characters [A-Za-z0-9_:-].** This is a limitation of our translate-tool app and not the PO file
format itself.

Entries in the template file **should be in alphabetical order**. This is so
that we can reduce the potential for merge noise, allowing us to focus on
specific changes rather than automatic re-ordering. You must either add your
entries in the correct order, or add them all at the bottom, then run
`scripts/alphabetiseAllTranslations.sh programmes` to move them into the correct ordering.

After saving the template file, run `scripts/updateTranslationsFromTemplate.sh programmes`
to add the new entries to all translation files.
Then edit the en.po file and Add your english translation
```
#.The English translation
msgid "my_shiny_new_entry"
msgstr "The English translation"
```

Finally commit and run a composer update in your target application.

#### To remove an entry:

Remove the entry from the programmes.pot template and run `scripts/updateTranslationsFromTemplate.sh programmes`

### Updating translation files with new translations (supplied by a translator in .po format)
There's a script that does most of this for you "updateLanguageFromSuppliedPO.sh".
For example, to update the Welsh translation file (language code "cy") from a new file supplied
by a translator, you would run
```
./scripts/updateLanguageFromSuppliedPO.sh ~/Downloads/new-translations-cy_GB.po programmes cy
```

Once you've done that, you'll probably want to run a diff to check everything's OK and remove any superfluous
headers added by the .po editor by hand. But the script should take care of any changes in ordering or new/wrong
entires that may have been added by the translator's .po editor. It uses msgmerge from the command line internally.

## Technical Detail

### Features
We support
* Fallback to a standard language (e.g. English) when translation string is not found in the current locale.
* Multiple message domains for translation, all loaded at once or separately (e.g. separate translation sets for radio and programmes if necessary)
* Loading direct from PO files (a pure text format, no complex build scripts). A caching facility is provided as instantiation of a full translation set from a .po file is expensive (~35ms)
* Logging via the observer pattern

### Configuration options
RMP\Translate provides extensive configuration options, which are supplied to TranslateFactory as an associative array. E.g.
```php
$factory = new TranslateFactory();
$options = array('fallback_locale' => 'en_GB', 'cachepath' => '/var/cache/bbc-pal-programmes/translate');
$translate = $factory->create('cy_GB', $options);
```
Supported options:
* **fallback_locale**: A language to pull translations from when a translation is not found in the default language. In the above example, an English translation will be used if a Welsh translation is not found. Defaults to disabled.
* **cachepath**: A directory, writable by your apache user, used by Symfony to store compiled versions of your .po files. Defaults to null (no caching). It is strongly recommended this be set in production. *WARNING*: Once Symfony writes a complied translation file it will not overwrite it even if Apache is restarted. You therefore need to version your cache directories in production or clear them on deployment.
* **domains**: Accepts an array of message domains (e.g. programmes, radio, iplayer), each containing a different translation set. Defaults to 'programmes'.
* **default_domain**: The message domain to pull translations from when another domain is not explicitly specified in the call to translate(). Defaults to 'programmes'
* **debug**: Enables cache invalidation in Symfony translate. Basically, this means that if you change your .po file, the cached version will be automatically updated. Do not set this in production for performance reasons. Defaults to false.
* **basepath**: Allows you to specify a base path for your .po files anywhere in the filesystem, or relative to the include path. Read TranslateFactory for more info. But it's probably best not to touch this and leave all translation files in their default localtion at [src/RMP/Translate/lang/](https://github.com/bbc/rmp-translate/tree/master/src/RMP/Translate/lang).

### Instantiation
It's best to only instantiate RMP\Translate once and store the resulting object somewhere for reuse (we use a singleton in /progs). Instantiation is relatively expensive, while translation is extremely cheap.

Note that TranslateFactory->construct() will throw a TranslationFilesNotFoundException if none of your supplied domains/languages/fallback languages actually exists. It will not complain as long as something  valid is actually found, so make sure your language files are actually being loaded during testing.

### Logging
You can get logging data from RMP\Translate by attaching an Observer. E.g.
```php
$factory = new TranslateFactory();
$translate = $factory->create($locale, $options);
$logger = new Logger(); // Logger can be anything that Implements our TranslateObserverInterface
$translate->attach($logger);
```
The logger will recieve [TranslateEvent](https://github.com/bbc/rmp-translate/blob/master/src/RMP/Translate/TranslateEvent.php) objects which should be trivial to log using your existing logging infrastructure.

Currently the logger will be notified in the event of missing translations or fallback translations.

### Unit Tests
There is a full suite of unit tests. Simply run PHPUnit in the project root.

### PO File Format
(this needs tiding up)
In order to allow the use of the custom rmp-translate-tool PO file editor, we have created certain extenstions to the PO file format. Basically, we whack in some specially formatted comments (#. "extracted comments" to be precise). These are perfectly valid standard .po comments, but have a special meaning to our app.

You can safely ignore this if you do not plan to use rmp-translate-tool

Current comments that have special meaning and are highlighted to the user with specific presentation are shown below:

For singular form:
```
#. English: "{The singular form of the English translation of placeholder_string}".
#. Example URL: {http://your-link-here} .
#. Type: {Body text|Heading}
msgid "placeholder_string"
msgstr "Foreign Language Translation here"
```
Plural form:
```
#. English (no items): "{English translation with 0 items}".
#. English (one item): "{English translation with 1 item}".
#. English (2+ items): "{English translation with 2+ items}".
msgid "available_items_count"
msgid_plural "available_items_count %count%"
msgstr[0] "Relevant foreign language translation..."
msgstr[1] "Relevant foreign language translation..."
msgstr[2] "Relevant foreign language translation..."
```
Substitutions:
```
#. %1 is a variable, which may contain the value: "{example value from /progs}".
msgid "something_with_substitutions"
msgstr "blah blah blah"
```
Priority (filtering)

Replace the curly braces and their contents with some (hopefully relevant and informative) text and
you're good to go. Any other comments will be displayed as plain text above the language entry somewhere.
```
#. Priority: {name of priority type, e.g. "schedules pages"}
msgid "something to prioritise"
msgstr "blah"
```
Replace the curly braces and their contents with some (hopefully relevant and informative) text and
you're good to go. Any other comments will be displayed as plain text above the language entry somewhere.
